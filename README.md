# Project: Wicki Viewer

View wikipidea using filtering phrase or loading a random article.

## Objective 

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

- User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

| Hint |------|
|------|------|
| 1    | Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.|
| 2    | Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.|
| 3    | Use this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=jsonfm) to experiment with Wikipedia's API.|

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
